# Weather App

A dynamic and intuitive web application that provides real-time weather information for any location. This project demonstrates my ability to integrate third-party APIs, handle asynchronous data, and build a user-friendly interface using modern web development practices.

## Features

-   **Real-time Weather Data:** Fetches and displays current weather conditions (temperature, humidity, wind speed, etc.) for specified cities.
-   **Location Search:** Allows users to search for weather information by city name.
-   **Responsive Design:** Optimized for a seamless experience across various devices, from mobile phones to desktop computers.
-   **Clean and Clear UI:** Presents weather data in an easily digestible and visually appealing format.

## Technologies Used

-   **HTML5:** Structures the layout and content of the weather application.
-   **CSS3:** Styles the application, providing a modern and responsive design.
-   **JavaScript (ES6+):** Manages all the interactive elements, API calls, and data manipulation.
-   **OpenWeather API:** Used to fetch meteorological data.
